# System Server Security

**System Server Security** is a website, with plans to evolve into a comprehensive web application, designed to simplify and provide a range of powerful tools for system administrators, developers, and UNIX (Linux) users. Its primary focus is on enhancing security for virtual private servers (VPS), system hardening, and providing intuitive security management for both technical and non-technical users.

## üåê Deployment

The website is hosted on a VPS and served with `Nginx` as the reverse proxy, with `Gunicorn` managing the Python Flask application.

- To manage the Gunicorn service, use:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status pyproj
   ```

The server is configured to handle requests efficiently and securely, ensuring the application remains responsive even under significant load.
